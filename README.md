# MCK
This repository holds code for preprocessing of MCK dataset.

Usage: download dataset from figshare, create two folders inside MCK, raw and outputs. Paste each language from dataset into raw folder. Run main.py, which will create 2.4 subclips from each video and saves it to chunks_dataset folder and preprocesses data and saves it into preprocessed_data folder.
